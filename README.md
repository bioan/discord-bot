# Dependencies
Requires discord.py, python-dotenv, and Python 3.5+ (requirement of discord.py)

Furthermore, a `.env` file with a `DISCORD_TOKEN=<application token>`is required.

# Future work

Possibly look into a nicer way to edit messages, monitored channels, etc.
Input could probably be handled through DMs by authorized users.
Configuration should probably be done through a separate file.
Handle players reacting with multiple roles.
